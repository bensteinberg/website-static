                The Library Innovation Lab is preparing to launch the Institutional Data Initiative (IDI), a new initiative to unlock
                and refine high quality training data at library, academic, and government institutions across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                By bridging the gap between model-makers and institutions through a world-class data practice, IDI stands to increase access to knowledge, empower
                contributing institutions and the cultures they represent, and advance the state of the art for all builders of AI.
            </p>
                <p>
                    The Lab is currently building partnerships with institutions and model-makers ahead of a public launch. Reach out to
