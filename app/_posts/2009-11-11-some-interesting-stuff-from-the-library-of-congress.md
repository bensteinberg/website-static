The LOC's Experience is the recent re-design/overhaul of the main building's exhibits.  It includes a number of technology innovations (digital wall, kiosk, large scale page turning and cross-referencing of key US documents, etc.) to enhance the experience of the LOC's visitors.  This project also includes a connection to an on-line experience to extend the visit beyond the time spent at the LOC.  The on-line experience is known as myLOC.
