We've had the pleasure of working with Dan Brickley this summer on a spectacularly difficult and interesting project, trying to figure out how to associate content from the Web with the sorts of categories used by libraries. In this podcast, Dan reflects on some of the general issues facing librarians trying to make Web-based distributed collections navigable, and how much hope we should have for a future of Linked Data. (I apologize for the sound quality. I recorded it from Skype, and without the expert help of the magnificent Dan Jones, the usual producer of our podcasts.)
