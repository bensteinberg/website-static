**Who are you, and what do you do?**

Hi, my name's Jeff.  I do design and new ideas here at the Lab.  The Lab ROCKS! It's a great job.  Sometimes I help make websites (like this one), sometimes I do [classes](http://www.librarytestkitchen.org/) and right now, even working on some [policy-ish stuff](http://librarylicense.org/) with folks from here and the [Berkman Center](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/).

**What hardware do you use?**

I have a mac tower that is cool.  I have 2 monitors, that's good.  I also have a Mac Mighty Mouse

I like the wheel, but gunk does get stuck in it so it requires maintenance.  I'd say the hardware I'm passionate about is the [Grado SR60 Headphones](http://www.gradolabs.com/page_headphones.php?item=f4ba8830232696b5f580bd531134b668).

Now those things actually rock. For those with immediate officemates or a quiet atmosphere they are quite acoustically transparent. The other piece of noise control technology I like is earplugs.

Both of these tools allow me to better get lost in thought...  I've been using earplugs since college, so at this point it's practically associative:  Ear Plugs in = (More) Focus

I also drink coffee out of a jar because I can put it in my bag, SEAL IT, and confidently ride to work without it spilling.

And that brings me to that ruler in the background.  I like the ruler, it has so many uses.

**What software do you use?**

Adobe Creative Suite, BBEdit, FileZilla, Outlook cause of Harvard U. buy-in, and Spotify.

**What would be your dream setup**

I'm curious about that inkling thing.  Maybe waiting for version two.

Well.  Now that I think about it, this would be my dream setup
