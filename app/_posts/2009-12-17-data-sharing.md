There was an impromptu Digital Lab conversation that happened yesterday.  I figured this'd be a good spot to post some of the notes, which are recurring thoughts from the past couple days really.

First off, here's the white board image, which while somewhat oblique at the moment, hopefully we'll update it in time.  Ben and I (Jeff) were discussing how sharing and circulation history can play a role in our system.

We got to talking about future data.  Anonymized data that's still on file now.

What can be gleaned from each set?

How these data (pluralizing data always confuses me) can be useful to users, etc.?
