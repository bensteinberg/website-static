The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law) now has scanned images available for download as PDF, with selectable text, for all open-access jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Illinois, North Carolina and New Mexico. To download scanned images by volume, visit our [downloads](https://case.law/download/) page and browse to the volume you seek: [https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/](https://case.law/download/PDFs/open/).

Through our [API](https://api.case.law) and [bulk data](https://case.law/bulk/download/) tools, researchers already have access to metadata and text files produced through OCR of the scanned images. With this new release, we're able to share the scanned images themselves in an enhanced form that enables text selection and search.

For this initial release, scanned images are available only for those jurisdictions that have taken the important step of ensuring that all of their current opinions are published and freely accessible online in an authoritative, machine-readable manner that avoids vendor-specific citation. As always, we're eager to work with other states seeking to take this step toward digital-first publishing. [Here's how to get started](https://case.law/action/).
