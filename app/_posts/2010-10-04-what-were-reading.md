On our [home page](/) and on the main blog page we run a list on the right of "Stuff we're looking at." These are various postings on the Web that one of us has founding interesting enough to share. We tag 'em and run the feed.

At some point, we'll start tweeting as well, and will probably automatically tweet what we're tagging. Unless you think that's a bad idea, in which case just forget we ever brought it up. So, WDYT?
