I feel waves of evilness from big tech companies.

I've _never_ felt evilness from a library.   Never even occurred to me.  They've been nothing but good to me.  Welcoming, safe---yes.  Evil?  No.

I trust libraries and it's well earned---they've spent decades defending privacy (primarily, I think, by not keeping records).  But could libraries begin to keep records, applying that same diligence and upholding of values?

I'd much sooner entrust a library with my [social graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph) than I would Facebook.
