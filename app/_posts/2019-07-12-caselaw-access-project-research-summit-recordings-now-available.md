Last month we hosted the [Caselaw Access Project Research Summit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0BQJtC5sNLYdoNYO6qV1b1yRh4NwwJduUqBPwE8Pt4/edit#). An international group of researchers joined us to share what they are creating with [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) data. We are excited to [share recordings of those presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5bjwZ2MwNlLK4F5a1BKPaDzW1ROU90M7) with you!

Are you using Caselaw Access Project data in your research? Tell us about it at [info@case.law](mailto:info@case.law).
