title: Caselaw Access Project Data Release and Bulk Metadata
author: kelly-fitzpatrick

The latest update to CAP makes bulk downloads of case metadata available by [jurisdiction](https://case.law/download/bulk_exports/20200604/by_jurisdiction/case_metadata/) and [reporter](https://case.law/download/bulk_exports/20200604/by_reporter/case_metadata/). This release also includes the `cites_to` field in bulk downloads, refines case citations, and removes duplicate volumes. 

We’re looking forward to seeing how you use this data in research, projects, and more. Have something to share? We’re excited to [hear about it](https://case.law/contact/).
