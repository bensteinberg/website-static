_A protester throwing cookies at the parliament._

Here are some things that caught our ear this fine Thursday at the International Internet Preservation Consortium web archiving conference<!--more-->:

  * Tom Storrar at the [UK Government Web Archive](http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/) reports on a user research project: ~20 in person interviews and ~130 [WAMMI](http://www.wammi.com/questionnaire.html) surveys resulting in 5 character vignettes. "WAMMI" replaces "WASAPI" as our favorite acronym.

  * How do we integrate user research into day-to-day development? We'll be chewing more on that one.

  * [Jefferson Bailey](http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/) shares the Internet Archive's learnings ups and downs with [Archive-It Research Services](https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/ARS/Archive-It+Research+Services). Projects from the last year include [.GOV](http://www.comparativeagendas.info/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Gade-and-Wilkerson.pdf) (100TB of .gov data in a Hadoop cluster donated by [Altiscale](https://www.altiscale.com/)), the L3S [Alexandria Project](http://alexandria-project.eu/), and something we didn't catch with Ian Milligan at [Archives.ca](http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Pages/home.aspx).

  * You too can learn archive research with Vinay Goel's [Archive Research Services Workshop](https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop).

  * PLUS Jefferson threw in some amazing stuff we still haven't quite figured out involving [iPython Notebooks with connections to big data sets](https://github.com/vinaygoel/ars-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/WAT-Analysis.ipynb).

  * What the WAT? We hear a lot about WATs this year. Common Crawl has a good [explainer](http://commoncrawl.org/2014/04/navigating-the-warc-file-format/).

  * [Ditte Laursen](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/ditte-laursen(3ae302d0-3c64-4e72-9227-a7612dd746a8).html) sets out to answer a big research question: "What does Danish web look like?" What is the shape of .dk? Eld Zierau reports that in a comparison of the Royal Danish Library's .dk collection with the Internet Archive's collection of Danish-language sites, only something like 10% were in both.

  * [Hugo Huurdeman](http://www.timelessfuture.com/about/) asks an important question: what exactly _is _a website? Is it a host, a domain, or a set of pages that share the same CSS? To visualize change in whatever that is, he uses [ssdeep](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep), a fuzzy hashing mechanism for page comparison.

  * Let's just pause to say how inspiring this all is. It's at about this point in the day that we started totally rethinking a project we've been working on for months.

  * [Justin Littman](https://twitter.com/justin_littman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) shares the [Social Feed Manager](http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager), his happenin' stack to harvest tweets and such.

  * We learned that TWARC is either twerking for WARCs or [a Twitter-harvesting Python package](http://library.gwu.edu/scholarly-technology-group/social-feed-manager) -- we're not entirely sure. Either way it's our new new favorite acronym. Sorry, WAMMI.

  * Nick Ruest and Ian Milligan give a very cool talk about sifting through hashtagged content on Twitter. Did you know that researchers only have 7-9 days to grab tweets under a hashtag before Twitter only makes the full stream available for a fee? (We did not know that.)

  * We were also impressed by Canada's huge amount of political social media engagement. Even though Canada isn't a huge country,[Ian's words not ours] 55,000 Tweets were generated in one day with the #elxn42 tag.

  * Fernando Melo of Arquivo.pt pointed out that the struggle is _real_ with live-web leaks in [his research comparing OpenWayback and pywb](https://github.com/Fernando-Melo/WaybackComparison). Fernando says in his tests OpenWayback was faster but [pywb](https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb) has higher-quality playbacks (more successes, fewer leaks). Both tools are expected to improve soon. We say it's time for something like [arewefastyet.com](https://arewefastyet.com/) to make this a proper competition.

  * Nicola Bingham is self-deprecating about the British Library's extensive QA efforts: "This talk title isn't quite right because it implies that we have Quality Assurance Practices in the Post Legal Deposit Environment." They use the [Web Curator Tool QA Module](http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/), but are having to go beyond that for domain-scale archiving.

  * We're also curious about this paper: [Current Quality Assurance Practices in Web Archiving](http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc333026/m2/1/high_res_d/QA_in_WebArchiving.pdf).

  * [Todd Stoffer](https://twitter.com/toddstoffer) demos NC State's [QA tool](http://go.ncsu.edu/qa-demo). A clever blend of tools like Google Forms, Trello, and IFTTT to let student employees provide archive feedback during downtime. Here are Todd's [snazzy HTML/JS] [slides](http://toddstoffer.github.io/presentation/IIPC-2016/#/).

TL;DR: lots of exciting things happening in the archiving world. Also exciting: the Icelandic political landscape. On the way to dinner, the team happened upon a [relatively small](http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/04/05/panama-papers-protest-pictures) protest right outside of the parliament. There was pot clanging, oil barrel banging, and an interesting use of an active smoke alarm machine as a noise maker. We were also handed "red cards" to wave at the government.

Now we're off to look for the northern lights!
