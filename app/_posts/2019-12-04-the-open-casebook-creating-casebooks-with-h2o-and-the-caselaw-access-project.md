What if you could create your own casebook with any case ever published? By connecting [H2O open casebooks](https://opencasebook.org/) with the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/), we can change how we read and create casebooks.

In higher education, open textbooks have created new ways to [learn, share, and adapt knowledge](https://sparcopen.org/open-education/) - and save students money in the meantime. For casebooks that can cost law students [hundreds](https://www.wklegaledu.com/Chemerinsky-Conlaw6) [of](https://www.wklegaledu.com/Massey-ConLaw6) [dollars](https://www.wklegaledu.com/Friedman-ConstitutionalLaw2) [each](https://www.wklegaledu.com/Templin-Contracts2), this gives law schools the opportunity to create casebooks to serve their communities. 

What do open casebooks look like? From [Contracts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/25965-contracts) (Prof. Charles Fried), [Criminal Law](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/28024-criminal-law-spring-2017) (Prof. Jeannie Suk-Gersen), [Civil Procedure](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/29269-civil-procedure-fall-2014) (Prof. I. Glenn Cohen), [Torts](https://opencasebook.org/casebooks/30206-zittrain-torts-playlist-spring-2013) (Prof. Jonathan Zittrain) and more, open casebooks are one way to create course content to support the future of legal education.
