title: "CAP Code Share: Caselaw Access Project API to CSV"

Today we’re going to learn how to write case data from the [Caselaw Access Project API](https://case.law/api/) to CSV. This post shows work from Jack Cushman, Senior Developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. 

The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) makes 6.7 million individual cases freely available from Harvard Law School Library. With this code, we can create a script to get case data from the Caselaw Access Project API, and write that data to a spreadsheet with Python. [This demo](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples/blob/master/api_to_csv/api_to_csv.py) is made available as part of the [CAP Examples](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples) repository on Github. [Let’s get started](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples/blob/master/api_to_csv/api_to_csv.py)! 

How does this script find the data it’s looking for? This happens with an API call using the CAP API, and retrieves all cases that include the words “first amendment”: [api.case.law/v1/cases/?search=first+amendment](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/?search=first+amendment). Want to create your own CAP API call? [Here’s how](https://case.law/api/). 

The Caselaw Access Project has structured, case-level metadata. You can query parts of that data using the CAP API with endpoints, like “court” or “jurisdiction”. [Here’s a rundown](https://case.law/api/#endpoints) of the endpoints we have. This demo gets data using these endpoints to write case data to a CSV file:  'id', 'frontend_url', 'name', 'name_abbreviation', 'citation', 'decision_date', 'jurisdiction'. You can adapt this code, and [choose your own endpoints](https://case.law/api/#endpoints). 

To run this script, find your CAP API key by [creating an account](https://case.law/user/register/) or [logging in](https://case.law/user/login/), and viewing your [user details](https://case.law/user/details).

This code is part of the [CAP Examples](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples) repository on Github, a place to find and share code for working with data from the Caselaw Access Project. Do you have code to share? We want to see this resource grow.
