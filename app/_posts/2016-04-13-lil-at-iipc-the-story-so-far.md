We're halfway through the International Internet Preservation Consortium's annual web archiving conference. Here are just a few notes from our time so far<!--more-->:

## April 12

  * [Andy Jackson](http://anjackson.net/) kicks the conference off with "Have I accidentally committed international journalism?" — he has contributed to the open source software that was used to review the Panama Papers.

  * [Andrea Goethals](http://library.harvard.edu/users/andreagoethals) describes the desire for smaller modules in the web archive tool chain, one of her conclusions from Harvard Library's [Environmental Scan of Web Archiving](http://library.harvard.edu/03112016-1203/harvard-library-environmental-scan-web-archiving). This was the first of many calls throughout the day for more nimble tools.

  * [Stephen Abrams](http://www.cdlib.org/contact/staff_directory/sabrams.html) shares the California Digital Library's success story with [Archive-It](https://archive-it.org/). "Archive-It is good at what it does, no need for us to replicate that service."

  * [John Erik Halse](https://github.com/johnerikhalse) encourages folks to contribute code and documentation. Don't be intimidated and just dive in.

  * There seems to be consensus that [Heritrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritrix) is a tool that everyone needs but no one is in charge of &mdash; that's tough for contributors. A few calls for the Internet Archive to ride in and save the day.

  * We're not naming names, but a number of organizations have had their IT departments, or IT contractors, seek to run virus scanners that would edit the contents of an archive after preservation. (Hint: it's not easy to archive malware, but "just delete it" isn't the answer.)

  * Some kind member of IIPC reminds us of the amazing [Malware Museum](https://archive.org/details/malwaremuseum) hosted by the Internet Archive.

  * [David Rosenthal](http://blog.dshr.org/) notes that Iceland has been called the ["Switzerland of bits"](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2010/06/icelands_media_law). After being in Reykjavik for only a few days, we sort of agree!

  * [Jefferson Bailey](http://www.jeffersonbailey.com/) of the Internet Archive echoed concerns about looming web entropy: there is significant growth in web archiving, but a concentration of storage for archives.

  * Nicholas Taylor of the [Stanford Digital Library](http://t.co/mtGnkpTDPY) is responsible for the most wonderful acronym of all time, WASAPI ("Web Archiving Systems API").

  * The [Memento Protocol](http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/) remains the greatest thing since sliced bread. (Here we refer to the web discovery standard, not the Jason Bourne movie.)

  * We chat with Michael Nelson about his projects at [ODU](https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/), from the [Mink](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mink-integrate-live-archi/jemoalkmipibchioofomhkgimhofbbem) browser plugin to the [icanhazmemento](https://twitter.com/icanhazmemento) Twitter bot.


## April 13

  * [Hjálmar Gíslason](https://hjalli.com/) points out that 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute. It would take 90,000 employees working full time to watch it all. Conclusion: Google needs to hire some people and get on this.

  * Hjálmar also mentions Tim Berners-Lee's [5-Star Open Data standard](http://5stardata.info/). Nice goal to work toward for Free the Law!

  * Vint Cerf on Digital Vellum: the Catholic Church has lasted for an awfully long time, and breweries tend to stick around a long time. How could we design a digital archiving institution that could last that long?

  * (Perma's suggestion: how about a TLD for URLs that never change? We were going to suggest .cool, because [cool URLs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html). But that seems to be taken.)

  * Ilya Kramer shows off the [first webpage ever](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) in the first browser ever, running in a simulated NeXT Computer, courtesy of [oldweb.today](http://oldweb.today).

  * [Dragan Espensch](https://twitter.com/despens?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) says [Rhizome](http://rhizome.org/) views the web as "performative media" while showing Jan Robert Leegte's [scrollbars](http://www.scrollbarcomposition.com/) piece through different browsers in [oldweb.today](http://oldweb.today). Sometimes the OS is the artwork.

  * [Matthew S. Weber](http://matthewsweber.com/) and [Ian Milligan](https://ianmilligan.ca/) have been running [web archive hackathons](http://archivesunleashed.ca) to connect researchers to computer programmers. Researchers need this: "It would be dishonest to do a history of the 90s without using web archives." Cue \<marquee\> tags here.

  * [Brewster Kahle](https://twitter.com/brewster_kahle) pitches the future of national digital collections, using as a model the fictional (but oh-so-cool) National Library of Atlantis. Shows off clever ways to browse a nation's tv news, books, music, video games, and so much more.

  * Brewster encourages folks to recognize that there is no "The Web" anymore: collections will differ based on context and provenance of the curator or crawler. (What is archiving "The Web" if each of us has a different set of sites that are blocked, allowed, or custom-generated for us?)

  * Brewster voices the need for broad, high level visualizations in web archives. He highlights [existing work](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/Research/Archive-Vis) and thinks we can push it further.

  * And oh by the way, he also shows off [Wayback Explorer](https://waybackexplorer.archivelab.org) over at [Archive Labs](https://archivelab.org/) -- graph major and minor changes in websites over time.

  * Bonus: We're fortunate enough to grab some whale sushi (or vegan alternatives) with David Rosenthal, Ilya Kreymer, and Dragan Espenschied.

Looking forward to the next couple of days ...
