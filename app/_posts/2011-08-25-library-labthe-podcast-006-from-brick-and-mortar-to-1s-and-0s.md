It's a challenging question, but libraries and museums aren't finding themselves replaced by the internet, as the cynical might assume. In fact, their roles as curators and archivists are becoming more important than ever.

[**Susan Hildreth**](http://www.imls.gov/about/staffdetail.aspx?StaffId=18) is the director of the [**Institute of Museum and Library Services**](http://www.imls.gov/) which serves the nation's 123,000 libraries and 17,500 museums.

Susan recently got on the phone with Harvard Library Innovation Lab's very own David Weinberger to talk about the role these brick and mortar institutions play in the digital age.
