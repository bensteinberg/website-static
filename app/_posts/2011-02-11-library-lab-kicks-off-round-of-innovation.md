Harvard's [Library Lab](http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab) has announced the [first projects](http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab/prop1) it will be funding. It's an exciting group, and we're proud that three of our projects made the list<!--more-->:

* _Library Analytics Toolkit_: Tools to enable libraries to understand, analyze, and visualize the patterns of activities, including checkouts, returns, and recent acquisitions, and to do so across multiple libraries.

* _LibraryCloud Server_: Build and maintain a web server that makes available to all Harvard library innovators data and metadata gathered from the Harvard libraries.

* _Library Innovation Podcasts_: A series of biweekly podcast interviews with library innovators about their projects and ideas. The initial series would consist of 15 podcasts of about 20 minutes each.

We're very excited about these, and have already begun work on them. In fact, if you have ideas for people to interview for our podcasts, let us know.
