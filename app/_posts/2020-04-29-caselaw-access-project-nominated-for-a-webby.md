The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) has been nominated for one of the [24th Annual Webby Awards](https://www.webbyawards.com/). We’re honored to be named alongside this year’s other [nominees](https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2020/websites/general-websites/law), including friends and leaders in the field like the [Knight First Amendment Institute](https://knightcolumbia.org/).

CAP makes 6.7 million cases freely available online from the collections of Harvard Law School Library. We’re creating new ways to access the law, such as our [case browser](https://cite.case.law/), [bulk data](https://case.law/bulk/) and [downloads](https://case.law/download/) for research scholars, and graphs that show [how words are used over time](https://case.law/trends/).

If you like what we're doing, we would greatly appreciate a minute of your time to [vote](https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2020/websites/general-websites/law) for the Webby People’s Voice Award in the category [Websites: Law](https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2020/websites/general-websites/law).

Do you have ideas to share with us? [Send them our way](https://case.law/contact/). We’re looking forward to hearing from you.
