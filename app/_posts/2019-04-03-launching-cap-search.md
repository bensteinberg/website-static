Today we're launching [CAP search](https://case.law/search/), a new interface to search data made available as part of the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) API. Since releasing the CAP API in Fall 2018, this is our first try at creating a more human-friendly way to start working with this data.

CAP search supports access to 6.7 million cases from 1658 through June 2018, digitized from the collections at the Harvard Law School Library. [Learn more](https://case.law/search-docs/) about CAP search and limitations.

We're also excited to share a new way to view cases, formatted in HTML. [Here's a sample](https://api.case.law/v1/cases/435800/?full_case=true&format=html)!

We invite you to experiment by building new interfaces to search CAP data. [See our code](https://github.com/harvard-lil/capstone/tree/develop/capstone/capbrowse) as an example.

The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) was created by the Harvard Library Innovation Lab at the [Harvard Law School Library](https://hls.harvard.edu/library/) in collaboration with project partner [Ravel Law](https://home.ravellaw.com/).
