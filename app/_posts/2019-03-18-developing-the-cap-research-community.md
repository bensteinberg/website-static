title: Developing the CAP Research Community

Since launching the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) API and bulk data service in October, we’ve been lucky to see a research community develop around this dataset. Today, we’re excited to share examples of how that community is using CAP data to create new kinds of legal scholarship.

Since October, we’ve seen our research community use data analysis to uncover themes in the Caselaw Access Project dataset, with examples like [topic modeling U.S. supreme court cases](https://github.com/abdulra4/Topic-Modelling-US-Court-Cases) and a [quantitative breakdown](https://towardsdatascience.com/harvard-caselaw-access-project-data-by-the-numbers-4f95f5b2b30a) of our data. We’ve also seen programmatic access to the law create a space to interface with the law in new ways, from creating [data notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/caselaw-eda-illinois) to [text and excerpt generators](https://case.law/gallery/limericks). 

Outside this space, data supported by the Caselaw Access Project has found its way into a [course assignment](https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/problem-set-1.html) to retrieve cases and citations with Python, a call to [expand the growing landscape of Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal/Caselaw_Access_Project_case_ID), and library guides on topics ranging from legal research to data mining. 

We want to see what you build with Caselaw Access Project data! Keep us in the loop at [info@case.law](mailto:info@case.law). Looking for ideas for getting started? Visit our [gallery](https://case.law/gallery/) and the [CAP examples repository](https://github.com/harvard-lil/cap-examples).
