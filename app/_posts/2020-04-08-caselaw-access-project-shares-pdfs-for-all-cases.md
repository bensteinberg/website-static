The [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/) is now making scanned PDFs available for every case in our collection. 
 
This update makes all cases in the [CAP case browser](https://cite.case.law/) available as PDF, digitized from the collections of Harvard Law School Library. When [viewing a case](https://cite.case.law/us/347/483/), just select the “view PDF” option above the title.
 
We’re also making volume-level PDFs available as part of [CAP downloads](https://case.law/download/PDFs). This will let users access PDF files for entire volumes, organized by jurisdiction and reporter.
 
Case and volume PDFs are available without restriction for our open jurisdictions (Illinois, Arkansas, New Mexico, and North Carolina). PDF files from closed jurisdictions are restricted to 500 cases per-person, per-day, with volume-level PDF access limited to authorized researchers.
 
This update creates new ways to read cases, online, for free. Are you using the Caselaw Access Project to read case law? [We’re looking forward to hearing about it](https://case.law/contact/).
