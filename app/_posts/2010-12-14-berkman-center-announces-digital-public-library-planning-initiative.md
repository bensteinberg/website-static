Our friend and older (and wiser) sibling, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, has [announced](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/newsroom/digital_public_library) it's going to host an initiative to explore creating a national digital public library. Given the high caliber and big-time Getting It of  the awesome steering committee, this could be very, very interesting. (Funding is coming from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.)
