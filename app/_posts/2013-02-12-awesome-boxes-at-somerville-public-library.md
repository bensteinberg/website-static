Our Awesome Boxes were itching to get their hands on even more books, music and movies so they jumped the fence and escaped Harvard Yard to their first public library home.  A box can now be found at each of the three branches of the [Somerville Public Library](http://www.somervillepubliclibrary.org/).

This partnership is utilizing the new hosted version of our awesome software.  If your library wants to sign up, just drop us a note ([http://awesomebox.io/](http://awesomebox.io/)) and we'll get you set up with an account.  All you'll need to start awesoming is a barcode scanner and a box (or basket, or bucket, or barrel).
