Lewis Hyde, author of [The Gift](http://www.lewishyde.com/pub/gift.html) and a Berkman Fellow, is giving a lunchtime talk a the Berkman Center tomorrow on the topic of his upcoming book _Common as Air_, which looks at how the founders of America viewed copyright and the commons. Lewis is a provocative and evocative thinker, and his [prior Berkman talk](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2009/06/09/berkman-lewis-hyde-on-the-commons/) when his book was in progress was fascinating.

If you'd like to attend, there are more details [here](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2010/06/hyde), including where to RSVP. Or, you can watch the [web cast](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/webcast) live or later.
