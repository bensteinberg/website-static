<div class="embed-container"><iframe title="Knight Prototype Workshop Dinner" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/193754983" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640"></iframe></div>

we hosted a bunch of amazing visitors earlier this week (knight prototype workshop!) and we were fortunate enough to gather everyone for dinner. after drinks were served, i used my phone's camera and swooped into each booth aka pocket of people.

swooping into these pockets of people is surprisingly meaningful and rich &mdash; i very much get a distinct sense for the vibe/mood/energy at each table. this swoop in and pan pattern is deep.

what should i do with these clips? feels like there's some coolness here but i can't seem to grab it. ideas?
