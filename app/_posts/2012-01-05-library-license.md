I posted an idea the other day.  It's called Library License.  It's a way to make works digitally available through libraries, after a specified amount of time has elapsed since publication date. It is a currently a sketch of an idea, to be evolved openly.  It's more a movement, perhaps in the form of a "drag n drop" clause that content creators may add to their licensing agreements with publishers. <!--more-->The idea is explained in full over here:

[www.librarylicense.org](http://librarylicense.org/)

This is new and not fully formed,  so I've added a comment area to the bottom of the LL page where we can talk about things.
