You may have seen [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc) links in a number of
documents of current interest, including [the Trial Memorandum of the
U.S. House of Representatives in the Impeachment Trial of President
Donald
J. Trump](https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/in_re_president_trump_house_impeachment_trial_brief_and_sof_1.18.20.pdf)
(archived at [https://perma.cc/BG56-2KXH](https://perma.cc/BG56-2KXH))
and [the Trial Memorandum of President Donald
J. Trump](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ukraine-clearinghouse-Trial-Memorandum-of-President-Donald-J.-Trump-january-20-2020.pdf)
(archived at
[https://perma.cc/XG5W-KRQF](https://perma.cc/XG5W-KRQF)). Interestingly,
both documents cite Perma links without citing the original URL that
Perma archived; [generally](https://perma.cc/docs#using-links), you
would include both in your citation.

As an [exercise](https://github.com/bensteinberg/pdf-perma-urls), I
used Perma's [public
API](https://perma.cc/docs/developer#developer-public-archives) to
look up the URLs for the Perma links cited in these two documents;
here are CSV files listing [the 148
links](https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/in_re_president_trump_house_impeachment_trial_brief_and_sof_1.18.20.csv)
in the House Memorandum (one ill-formed) and [the 129
links](https://lil-blog-media.s3.amazonaws.com/ukraine-clearinghouse-Trial-Memorandum-of-President-Donald-J.-Trump-january-20-2020.csv)
in the President's memorandum. (Note that both CSV files include
duplicates, as some links are repeated in each document; I'm leaving
the duplicates in place in case you want to read along with the
original documents.)
