"Your average citizen is not technologically savvy," says Marilyn Johnson, the author of [_This Book Is Overdue!: How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All_](http://www.marilynjohnson.net/_i_this_book_is_overdue___i__89022.htm)

Even as technology takes over more and more of our lives many of us are living in a technology cemetery, filled with old gadgets we have no idea how to revive, computers we don't know how to program, and ebooks we have no idea how to download to.

Johnson argues that this is a huge opportunity for libraries to revive their place as centers of the community, for librarians to exist not just as oracles of the reference book, but as guides to the technical world.

She spoke with David Weinberger about exactly how this might happen.
