*This post relates to [H2O Open Casebook](https://opencasebook.org/), our tool for law professors to make open, remixable casebooks, and the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/), our project to digitize the law of the United States.*

H2O Open Casebook makes the law fresher for students by letting professors teach from recent and relevant cases instead of cases involving steam engines and horses.

Today we’re making that even easier by adding new cases to search and import from [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/). CourtListener has all 7 million cases from our own Caselaw Access Project, which we use for cases up to 2018, as well as millions of more recent or unpublished decisions collected directly from court websites. If you use H2O, you’ll now automatically get cases from this larger and more up-to-date collection.

This project is part of our larger plan to share effort with CourtListener, following the [successful release of our Caselaw Access Project](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/), to ensure access to law for everyone.

Keep an eye on our blog for more announcements, coming soon.
