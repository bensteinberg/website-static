From the Disruptive Library Technology Jester, certain libraries are providing Google Books with [anonymized circulation data](http://dltj.org/article/mashups-of-bib-data/#anonymized_circulation_data) to feed into their relevance ranking algorithm.  I would love to know which libraries are providing this data.  Anyone?
