**Who are you, and what do you do?**

I'm Jessica. I just finished up the urban planning masters program over at the [GSD](http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/). I'm hanging out at the lab for the summer, working primarily on[ Time/Slice]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2012/06/14/timeslice/), a project I started in the [Library Test Kitchen](http://librarytestkitchen.org/). The Lab is very awesome.

**What hardware do you use?**

My most important hardware is my pen, which is a rotring extra-fine fountain pen. It was originally quite long; I had one break in my pocket so I sawed off the end and duct taped it. Now it fits in my pocket much better. My other piece of important hardware is a binder clip, which holds together a lot of printer paper full of my calendar, lists, notes, etc.

I rely on my MacBook Pro (4,1) for most things. It has a vintage 2008 battery that generates excessive heat, which can be nice in the winter. I also have an i5 iMac that I use for heavier stuff (a lot of GIS). My phone is a Nokia 6315i. The antenna broke off (also a pocket-related accident), so it is super svelte now. I have a Kindle Touch that I like a lot more than I expected to.

**What software do you use?**

A lot of Adobe Creative Suite, mostly Illustrator, for design. Other than that, I like free things. For mapping I do use ArcGIS, but I've gotten really into [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) recently. It makes maps that are nice and pretty. I use [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) for coding, and [Bean](http://www.bean-osx.com/Bean.html) for typing words. When I really really need to write something, [ommwriter](http://www.ommwriter.com/) is helpful.

[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) makes using my computer a lot more enjoyable, as does  [f.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/) and [jumpcut](http://jumpcut.sourceforge.net/). [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) helps me to not lose all my important things. I use [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/index.php) for keeping important information on my desktop, such as the weather and my new year's resolutions. My computer counts [electric sheep](http://www.electricsheep.org/) when it sleeps.

I go back and forth between Chrome and Firefox, but with both I love [TabCloud](https://chrometabcloud.appspot.com/) and and [being able to send articles straight to my Kindle](http://fivefilters.org/kindle-it/).

**What would be your dream setup?**

My dream setup would be a fort that could also get lots of sunlight. It would also have a little stop-motion animation setup ready to go at all times. It might be in a tree.
