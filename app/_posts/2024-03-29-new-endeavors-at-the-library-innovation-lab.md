This month, the Library Innovation Lab celebrated the [full and unqualified release](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/) of the Caselaw Access Project data. We took the opportunity to gather and look to the future at [Transform: Justice on March 8th](http://lil.law.harvard.edu/about/cap-celebration). The event reminded us of what we already knew: the open legal data movement is alive and well. 

In addition to hearing the story of CAP, librarians, vendors, and advocates had conversations about future paths for accessing the law. Noted open-access activist Carl Malamud made his pitch for a [Full Faith and Credit Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTIIfCp1Ufk). 

As we see CAP move on to a new chapter, LIL is excited to bring the same experimental mindset that allowed for such an ambitious project into other endeavors. 

Here’s some of what’s coming up next at the Library Innovation Lab: 

### Facilitating open, equitable access to knowledge

**[COLD Cases](https://huggingface.co/datasets/harvard-lil/cold-cases)**: We’re excited to be collaborating with the [Free Law Project](http://www.free.law) on a couple of projects. First, we worked with FLP to create Cold Cases, a pipeline for standardizing and sharing bulk legal data. And now that it is able to fully leave the nest, to consolidate efforts and continue to provide access to CAP’s data it will now live alongside FLP’s other extensive resources. 

**[Teraflop & CAP](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1766157444936507837.html)**: It’s great to already see work by the AI community in processing the CAP dataset for legal understanding, such as this work by Teraflop to generate text embeddings and search indexes for the data.

**Future Collaborations**: We see huge potential for Harvard to be a neutral platform that can help release data that helps the whole industry. We are having interesting conversations with companies like Westlaw, LexisNexis, and vLex that see potential to this kind of partnership, and we hope to make more connections like that soon.
 
### Empower everyone – AI, understanding, access to justice

**[Library Innovation Lab Artificial Intelligence Fund](http://lil.law.harvard.edu/about/ai)**: Lexis Nexis is the first funder of our AI fund, which has been set up to support exploration at the edge of law, AI technology, libraries, and society.

**[Open Legal AI Workbench](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/08/announcing-the-open-legal-ai-workbench-olaw/)**: There will be lots of innovation and creation in the legal AI space in the near future. Our recently released Open Legal AI Workbench is a simple, well-documented, and extensible framework for legal AI researchers to build services using tool-based retrieval augmented generation. 
 
### Leveling up both of these approaches

**Institutional Data Initiative**: Keep your eyes peeled for more news about an endeavor we have in the works to create a trusted conduit for helping data get from where it is to where it needs to be. The Institutional Data Initiative aims to scale the types of collaborations we discussed on Friday between knowledge institutions and industry partners. High-quality corpora and collection expertise paired with industry resources stands to grow knowledge and the public interest in lockstep with AI.
