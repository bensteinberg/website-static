      <h3>What does the Library Innovation Lab do?</h3>
      <div class="slice-body">
        We are a software and design lab tucked inside the world's largest academic law library, building tools and
        communities for open knowledge. We build open-source software and web services, available to everyone and in
        the public interest, to explore and to solve emerging information problems from our shared perspective as
        librarians, programmers, artists, and lawyers.
        We currently support three long-running services (
          <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma</a>,
          <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O Open Casebook</a>, and the
          <a href="https://case.law">Caselaw Access Project</a>
        ) as well as a range of shorter term experiments.

      <h3>What’s our story?</h3>
      <div class="slice-body">
        <p>We’re a dynamic group of thinkers and doers working to make libraries better by exploring the countless, dimly lit pathways that connect libraries to the larger world.</p>

        <p>We focus our energy on a handful of large multi-year projects and a number of small projects we call sketches. Our large projects are ambitious undertakings that reflect our long-term mission and efforts. Sketches are experiments and provocations that are often driven by one or two folks in the Lab.</p>

        <p>We’re stationed in the Harvard Law School Library and benefit greatly from the deep legal thinking and scholarship that surrounds us. We often approach library challenges using our law school library lens, but we work hard to make sure our local efforts have broad application. Libraries are universal.</p>

        <p>Our group’s culture is freewheelin’ and open. We welcome new ideas and new collaborations. Let’s work together to make libraries better.</p>
