    >The Library Innovation Lab is bringing together experts who are driving the
    development, adoption, and regulation of AI technology as it rewires society
    and the law along with it.</em

<p>
  Note: this page is for the Harvard Law AI Summit on September 19, 2023. This
  is an invitation only event.
</p>

<h2>Recommended Readings</h2>
<p>
  We don’t have required readings, but we do have some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNSWdWoAQ-4_r4HzdTsGk8wJmnPB60y1Hr91Devniz4/edit#heading=h.dpq3r4f3vvga">interesting
  suggestions</a>,
  many of them written by conference participants. Feel free to skim and check
  out anything that catches your eye. We will be updating the list as we receive
  additional suggestions.
</p>

<h2>Guest List</h2>
<p>
  As this is an invitation-only gathering with an aim to create connections, we
  are sharing the guest list with all participants. This <a href="(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mm7HwnyaOjaE57J1K12vNb-iq5vZ7wrzmhfys7T-oFs/edit#gid=1268423724">participant
  list</a>
  is public for attendees during the summit and then will be shared directly
  following the event.

<h2>AI Projects at LIL</h2>
<p>
  Generative AI offers a defining moment where information archives gain the
  ability to answer questions about themselves; to act without human
  intervention; and even to infer and replicate the processes that created them.
  From our perspective at the lab - where we bring library principles to
  technological frontiers - anyone who is concerned with information, access,
  and the law should be aware of and feel empowered to influence the use of
  generative AIs. We have embarked upon a series of projects in support of that
  belief.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to the Harvard Law AI Summit, here’s what else we’ve been up to at
  LIL:
</p>

<h3>LIL Vector</h3>
<p>lil_vector is our community server for experimenting with generative AI technology. Located in LIL space, this machine learning workstation equipped with two A6000 GPUs allows us to freely explore the potential of open-source AI models. 
But more than a shared compute resource, it is a nascent community hub on which technologists from LIL and beyond share resources and experiments, as we collectively make sense of this AI moment.</p>

<h3>Collaborative Open Legal Data (COLD) Dataset</h3>
<p>
  In 2017, the Harvard Law Library kicked off the Caselaw Access Project (CAP),
  by digitizing 360 years of U.S. case law. The Library Innovation Lab (LIL)
  transformed it into the largest U.S. legal database of its time. Much of this
  data is public and discoverable for free on LIL's site
  <a href="https://case.law">case.law.</a>
</p>

<p>
  The legal nonprofit <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a> ingested
  data from CAP, among other sources of similar data, to create a ever-growing
  legal dataset and made it available on
  <a href="http://courtlistener.com/">CourtListener.com</a> as a searchable web
  portal, via APIs, and bulk exports from their database.
</p>

<p>
  The Library Innovation lab has assembled this data into a dataset suitable for
  machine learning and made it available on
  <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/harvard-lil/cold-cases"
    >HuggingFace</a
  >, along with a
  <a
    href="https://datanutrition.org/labels/v3/?id=c29976b2-858c-4f4e-b7d0-c8ef12ce7dbe"
    >Data Nutrition Label</a
  >
  which explains the source of the data and gives guidelines for ethical use.
  The result is information about over 8 million court cases are available for
  batch processing, for example in the context of data science and AI
  experiments.
</p>

<h2>Google books</h2>
<p>A joint project between the Library Innovation Lab and Harvard Library,
including Library Technology Services, to compile Harvard’s Google Books data
and publish it as a dataset that has been optimized for machine learning. In
2005, Harvard worked with Google to scan over 1 million out-of-copyright books,
all published before 1923. Those books have never been openly published as a
dataset, and due to the initial agreement with Google, can only be published by
a Harvard entity. LIL has been working with Harvard Library LTS to do just that.</p>

<h2>Open French Law Chatbot</h2>
<p>This experiment explores whether an open-source LLM (Llama 2) can act as both
translator and French law “expert” if provided with the entirety of French codes
as “embeddings”. The case study will delve into the potential and limitations of
open-source LLMs and associated toolchains, and to what extent embeddings models
and vector databases can augment and “ground” the responses provided by LLMs. In
addition, LIL will publish the embeddings database containing the entirety of
French law.</p>

<h2>Library Data Trust</h2>
<p>Research into speculative funding structures for libraries and their
collections. The Library Data Trust would set up a structure whereby libraries
and archives digitized their collections and made them available for a fee to
commercial users and for free to everyone else. The goals would be to make more
collections available to more people while securing the financial future of
libraries.</p>

<h2>LLMs and Book Ban Benchmark</h2>
<p>Are LLMs champions of the freedom to read? The impetus of this experiment was
the news that an
<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/iowa-chatgpt-book-ban/"
  > Iowa school district relied on ChatGPT’s responses to determine which books
  to remove from the library.</a> We asked five different LLMs to provide a
  justification for removing Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye from library shelves
  with the objective of demonstrating how “guardrails” differ among models and
  assessing the impact of altering the temperature parameter. About 75% of the
  responses across all five LLMs justified removing the book from library
  shelves. The case study will be published as part of Banned Books Week in
  October.
