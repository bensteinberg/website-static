                The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians, programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
                build open-source tools and services for open knowledge, available to everyone and in the public interest,
                that solve emerging information problems from the perspective of the world's largest academic law library.
                We currently support three long-running services (

                On the tech side, we work most often with Django, Vue, and Postgres.

                LIL offers a rare mix of contemplation and action: we are a small software lab within one of the world’s
                largest law libraries, with a mission both to try new things and to think deeply about what ought to exist
                for the long haul. Our mission offers a range of benefits for staff:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Job stability and support. While we maintain the creative atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're backed by an established institution with strong benefits and support for employees.</li>
                <li>Room to pursue your research agenda. We are located at the Harvard Law School Library and share a kitchen with  the Berkman Klein Center and metaLAB. Going to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly perspective, and exploring it through creative projects are encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at the cost of shipping the next feature.</li>
                <li>Set your own pace. We are a small, self-directed group that depends on internal motivation rather than externally imposed crunch time.</li>
                <li>Build open source. All of our projects are open source and otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our work.</li>
                <li>Work on stuff that matters. The projects we make are measured by how they help people in the long term.</li>

              <p>
                We are based in a newly-renovated space on the Harvard Law School campus. Our full-time staff positions are
                hybrid/in-person; we typically aim to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. Contractor and fellowship
                positions may be remote by individual arrangement.

                The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the

                experience, racial identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much

                The Library Innovation Lab offers a small number of
                stipended fellowships to people developing tools and
                communities to explore the future of open knowledge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Who should apply:</strong> Fellowships are a particularly good fit for people&mdash;
                inside and outside academia!&mdash;with a track record of
                building tools or leading communities that advance the
                conversation about cultural knowledge and the internet,
                and who need financial and institutional support to take
                their next steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                By "cultural knowledge and the internet," we mean
                questions like: how do established cultural memory
                institutions adapt to the internet age and help societies
                reconstruct and remember their history? How do societies
                govern themselves, coordinate solutions to problems, and
                decide who to trust in the evolving information landscape?
                How do we preserve today's knowledge for future
                generations?
              </p>
              <p>
                In short, who are we, how did we get here, and where are
                we going? And who is "we" in a networked world anyway?
              </p>
              <p>
                By "track record of building tools or leading
                communities," we mean that we want to see your theory of
                change and how it operates in the world: how have your
                beliefs about who we are, where we came from, and where
                we're going been translated to action, whether in code, in
                writing, or in community organizing, and what are your
                next steps?
              </p>
              <p>
                More concretely, strong fellowship applicants could include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Coders building software to help small institutions or
                  communities run and preserve their own digital archives
                </li>
                <li>
                  Librarians leading movements for internet access and
                  digital literacy
                </li>
                <li>

              </ul>
      
              <p>
                <strong>Fellowship details:</strong> Fellowships are individually arranged on a rolling basis,
                and may be any length from a week to a year. Fellows are
                expected to visit Harvard in person for a portion of the
                appointment, but need not be present full time. Stipends
                are available to support full-time work, but may be
                prorated depending on time commitment and other sources of
                support.

        <h3 id="about">About us</h3>
        <p>
          The Library Innovation Lab is a team of librarians, programmers, artists, and lawyers with a broad mission: to
          build open-source tools and services for open knowledge, available to everyone and in the public interest,
          that solve emerging information problems from the perspective of the world's largest academic law library.
          We currently support three long-running services (
            <a href="https://perma.cc">Perma</a>,
            <a href="https://opencasebook.org">H2O Open Casebook</a>, and the
            <a href="https://case.law">Caselaw Access Project</a>
          ) as well as a range of shorter-term experiments.
          On the tech side, we work most often with Django, Vue, and Postgres.
        </p>
        <h3 id="why">Why work with us?</h3>
        <p>
          LIL offers a rare mix of contemplation and action: we are a small software lab within one of the world’s
          largest law libraries, with a mission both to try new things and to think deeply about what ought to exist
          for the long haul. Our mission offers a range of benefits for staff:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job stability and support. While we maintain the creative atmosphere and flexibility of a small innovation lab, we're backed by an established institution with strong benefits and support for employees.</li>
          <li>Room to pursue your research agenda. We are located at the Harvard Law School Library and share a kitchen with  the Berkman Klein Center and metaLAB. Going to events, having conversations, developing your scholarly perspective, and exploring it through creative projects are encouraged. We will specifically prioritize these things at the cost of shipping the next feature.</li>
          <li>Set your own pace. We are a small, self-directed group that depends on internal motivation rather than externally imposed crunch time.</li>
          <li>Build open source. All of our projects are open source and otherwise designed to maximize the public benefit of our work.</li>
          <li>Work on stuff that matters. The projects we make are measured by how they help people in the long term.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="location">Location</h3>
        <p>
          We are based in a newly-renovated space on the Harvard Law School campus. Our full-time staff positions are
          hybrid/in-person; we typically aim to be in the office Tuesday through Thursday. Contractor and fellowship
          positions may be remote by individual arrangement.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ediba">Equity, diversity, inclusion, belonging and antiracism</h3>
        <p>
          The work and well-being of the Lab are strengthened profoundly by the
          diversity of our community and our differences in background, culture,
          experience, racial identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and much
          more. We actively seek and welcome applications from Black and Indigenous people and people of color;
          women and non-binary people; the LGBTQ+ community; and people with disabilities; as well as
          applications from researchers and practitioners from across the
          spectrum of disciplines, methods, and life experiences.

        <h3 id="fellows">Fellows</h3>
        
        <p>
          The Library Innovation Lab offers a small number of
          stipended fellowships to people developing tools and
          communities to explore the future of open knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Who should apply:</b> Fellowships are a particularly good fit for people&mdash;
          inside and outside academia!&mdash;with a track record of
          building tools or leading communities that advance the
          conversation about cultural knowledge and the internet,
          and who need financial and institutional support to take
          their next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          By "cultural knowledge and the internet," we mean
          questions like: how do established cultural memory
          institutions adapt to the internet age and help societies
          reconstruct and remember their history? How do societies
          govern themselves, coordinate solutions to problems, and
          decide who to trust in the evolving information landscape?
          How do we preserve today's knowledge for future
          generations?
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, who are we, how did we get here, and where are
          we going? And who is "we" in a networked world anyway?
        </p>
        <p>
          By "track record of building tools or leading
          communities," we mean that we want to see your theory of
          change and how it operates in the world: how have your
          beliefs about who we are, where we came from, and where
          we're going been translated to action, whether in code, in
          writing, or in community organizing, and what are your
          next steps?
        </p>
        <p>
          More concretely, strong fellowship applicants could include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Coders building software to help small institutions or
            communities run and preserve their own digital archives
          </li>
          <li>
            Librarians leading movements for internet access and
            digital literacy
          </li>
          <li>
            Archivists developing novel practices to empower
            communities not benefitting from traditional archives
          </li>
          <li>
            Artists and authors helping to explore and translate the
            cultural impact of new technologies
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Fellowship details:</b> Fellowships are individually arranged on a rolling basis,
          and may be any length from a week to a year. Fellows are
          expected to visit Harvard in person for a portion of the
          appointment, but need not be present full time. Stipends
          are available to support full-time work, but may be
          prorated depending on time commitment and other sources of
          support.
