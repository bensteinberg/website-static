          <p>
            The Harvard Library Innovation Lab seeks paid, contract
            researchers with substantial technical skills to help us
            explore and document cutting-edge data storage
            platforms. At the core of this research is the question:
            how can important data be stored for the long term with
            the least cost and risk?
          </p>

          <h3>Who should apply?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a great project for any technologist who enjoys
            exploring open source repos and testing how they perform
            in real world conditions; it may be particularly
            interesting to academic technologists or open source
            hackers looking for an excuse to learn more about
            peer-to-peer data storage and other strategies for
            long-term cultural preservation.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the project?</h3>
          <p>
            The project will include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selecting a range of data storage technologies for
              analysis, including API storage providers like Amazon
              S3, established data archival platforms like LOCKSS,
              emerging data replication protocols like IPFS and
              hypercore, and emerging data storage offerings like Sia,
              Storj, and Filecoin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selecting analysis criteria for the selected
              technologies, such as cost, complexity, durability, and
              security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing the selected technologies with data of
              substantial size and cultural value (such as the data
              collected by
              our <a href="/projects/perma-cc">Perma.cc</a>
              and <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project">Case.law</a>
              projects) to understand their real world performance and
              user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Publishing a comparison of the selected technologies
              both as text and as code for others to build
              on. Everything built at our Lab will be released as open
              source.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Work location and funding</h3>
          <p>
            Work may be in person at Harvard Law School or
            remote. Funding is available for hourly contracts or
            academic stipends depending on the nature of your
            interest.

            The Library Innovation Lab offers a small number of
            stipended fellowships to people developing tools and
            communities to explore the future of open knowledge.
          </p>
          <h3>Who should apply</h3>
          <p>
            Fellowships are a particularly good fit for people&mdash;
            inside and outside academia!&mdash;with a track record of
            building tools or leading communities that advance the
            conversation about cultural knowledge and the internet,
            and who need financial and institutional support to take
            their next steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            By "cultural knowledge and the internet," we mean
            questions like: how do established cultural memory
            institutions adapt to the internet age and help societies
            reconstruct and remember their history? How do societies
            govern themselves, coordinate solutions to problems, and
            decide who to trust in the evolving information landscape?
            How do we preserve today's knowledge for future
            generations?
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, who are we, how did we get here, and where are
            we going? And who is "we" in a networked world anyway?
          </p>
          <p>
            By "track record of building tools or leading
            communities," we mean that we want to see your theory of
            change and how it operates in the world: how have your
            beliefs about who we are, where we came from, and where
            we're going been translated to action, whether in code, in
            writing, or in community organizing, and what are your
            next steps?
          </p>
          <p>
            More concretely, strong fellowship applicants could include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Coders building software to help small institutions or
            communities run and preserve their own digital archives
            </li>
            <li>
              Librarians leading movements for internet access and
              digital literacy
            </li>
            <li>
              Archivists developing novel practices to empower
              communities not benefitting from traditional archives
            </li>
            <li>
              Artists and authors helping to explore and translate the
              cultural impact of new technologies
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Fellowship details</h3>
          <p>
            Fellowships are individually arranged on a rolling basis,
            and may be any length from a week to a year. Fellows are
            expected to visit Harvard in person for a portion of the
            appointment, but need not be present full time. Stipends
            are available to support full-time work, but may be
            prorated depending on time commitment and other sources of
            support.
