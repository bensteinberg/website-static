            The Harvard Library Innovation Lab seeks paid, contract
            researchers with substantial technical skills to help us
            explore and document cutting-edge data storage
            platforms. At the core of this research is the question:
            how can important data be stored for the long term with
            the least cost and risk?
          </p>

          <h3>Who should apply?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a great project for any technologist who enjoys
            exploring open source repos and testing how they perform
            in real world conditions; it may be particularly
            interesting to academic technologists or open source
            hackers looking for an excuse to learn more about
            peer-to-peer data storage and other strategies for
            long-term cultural preservation.
          </p>

          <h3>What is the project?</h3>
          <p>
            The project will include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selecting a range of data storage technologies for
              analysis, including API storage providers like Amazon
              S3, established data archival platforms like LOCKSS,
              emerging data replication protocols like IPFS and
              hypercore, and emerging data storage offerings like Sia,
              Storj, and Filecoin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selecting analysis criteria for the selected
              technologies, such as cost, complexity, durability, and
              security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing the selected technologies with data of
              substantial size and cultural value (such as the data
              collected by
              our <a href="/projects/perma-cc">Perma.cc</a>
              and <a href="/projects/caselaw-access-project">Case.law</a>
              projects) to understand their real world performance and
              user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Publishing a comparison of the selected technologies
              both as text and as code for others to build
              on. Everything built at our Lab will be released as open
              source.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Work location and funding</h3>
          <p>
            Work may be in person at Harvard Law School or
            remote. Funding is available for hourly contracts or
            academic stipends depending on the nature of your
            interest.
          </p>
